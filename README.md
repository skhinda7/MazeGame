## Getting Started

This is my homework assignment for CS 225 at Embry-Riddle Aeronutical University. This is completed with week-by-week homework assignments throughout the semester. Requirements, instructions, and information about the game were provided by the instructor. It will be updated with each homework until the entire maze game is complete and able to run. 

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> If you want to customize the folder structure, open `.vscode/settings.json` and update the related settings there.

## Dependency Management

The `JAVA PROJECTS` view allows you to manage your dependencies. More details can be found [here](https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-java-dependency#manage-dependencies).
